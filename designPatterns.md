# Why Design Patterns?


### Design Problem

need flexible and reusable

### What does it solve?

Instead of solving OOPS problem with basic object oriented principles, use actual solutions used in Industries.

- 23 Design patterns

Ref: [Design Patterns by Erich Gamma](Designpatterns23.pdf)

### Similarity of Design patterns - Chess

Like a Chess
 - Isolated Pawn
 - Exposed King


### Where is Design pattern applicable

- Solve a design problem that may have been encountered before
- not tailored for unique problems
- Used for structurless sphagetti code

## Common Misconceptions    
- Not a source code, like java libraries or framework
- its a bit more conceptual

### Uses and Examples
-   Used to create Design Vocabulary
Ex: two objects created from a class, where one object is dependent on the second one, if the property of second object changes, then it should notify the second one.
- How do you solve it?
    - Superclasses
    -Interfaces
    -etc

### Solution: Observer Pattern

2. [MAINTEST](TestBMS.java)
